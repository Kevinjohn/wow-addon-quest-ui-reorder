# Security Policy

This is a World of Warcraft addon: it runs as Lua inside the game's addon
sandbox. It has no access to your filesystem, makes no network connections, and
cannot run arbitrary code outside the client. The only data it stores is its own
saved-variables table (`QuestUIReorderDB`), kept locally by the WoW client with
your other addon settings.

In other words, the realistic attack surface is small. The most likely
"security" issues are things like the addon mishandling data from a quest or
tracker API in a way that causes a Lua error. Those are welcome as ordinary
[bug reports](https://github.com/Kevinjohn/wow-addon-quest-ui-reorder/issues).
